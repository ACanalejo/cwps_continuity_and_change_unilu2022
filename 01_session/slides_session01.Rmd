## 02. Mapping the terrain: political parties and party-systems

- What is a political party?
  
- A political party, for the sake of this seminar, is a hierarchical organizations that compete for votes to achieve office, with the aim of implementing its preferred policies

- What is a party-system?
  
- The interaction of parties competing in the given electoral market. It is characterised by the number, size, and ideological preferences of the parties, among other aspects  


## 02. Mapping the terrain: political parties and party-systems

- Why is it important to study political parties and party-system?

- It help us to understand a myriad of political phenomena. Each party-system indicates levels of societal fragmentation and polarization, the most likely electoral and policy outcomes at a given moment in time, potential coalitions, etc. Comparatively, it helps us to assess dynamics of evolution of the public opinion, foresee potential reforms, alliances...

- In the end, party politics is a crucial aspect of political science: 'the science of (public) power'

- In this seminar, we will try to understand why European party-systems looks like they are today, considering how they were born and evolve, which will surely help us to assess the future that awaits us (but never predict it!)
