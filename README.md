# Comparative Western European Party Systems: Continuity and Change

University of Lucerne - Academic Year 2021-2022, Spring Term

## Course description

Electoral volatility has largely increased in Western Europe in the last two decades. The average duration of cabinet formation processes has escalated as a result of growing polarization and party system fragmentation. These changes have not been gradual, but have responded to different 'transformation waves' in which new party types have been incorporated into national parliaments heterogeneously across Western European democracies. When did these changes begin? What are the reasons behind them and why do different party systems follow different patterns?

The goal of this seminar is to provide students with a set of conceptual and empirical tools to answer these questions. It aims to get them familiar with the evolution of Western European party systems from a historical and comparative perspective so that they can identify patterns of continuity and change. To do so, it will review the main political theories of party system formation and change in Europe, with a particular emphasis in cleavage theory. The course is divided into two weekend-blocks. The first block will consist of a review of European party systems, focusing on their main changes from the 1960s until now. The second block will discuss the most relevant (electoral) demand and supply factors provided by the literature to explain these changes.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Identify the main theories of party system formation and change in Western Europe

- Critically assess the appropriateness of different theories to specific European regions and historical contexts

- Apply these theories to analyse different cases from a comparative and historical perspective

- Trace the logical continuity of the development of modern cleavage theory

- Identify the main European political party families and their historical correlates

- Understand the concept of electoral volatility and interpret analyses using its most common empirical indicators

- Think of elections as electoral markets in which demand and supply factors interact to produce electoral outcomes (i.e., seats and govt. coalitions)

- Read scientific articles with a critical perspective and present critical written responses

- Work in collaboration with others

- Orally present their work to a broad audience

## Course organization

The course is organized as a four-day intensive seminar divided in two weekend blocks. The first block consists of a review of European party systems, focusing on their main changes from the 1960s until now. It is structured as follows. First, we will review the main arguments of the cleavage theory as originally proposed by Lipset and Rokkan (1967), making particular emphasis on the so-called 'freezing hypothesis' (i.e., European party systems in the 1960s largely resemble their original structure in the 1920s). Second, we will discuss the incorporation of two new party families into the political landscape in the following decades (Green and Radical Right Parties). We will assess the impact of these changes using the same indicators discussed by Mair (1993) and we will try to make sense of them by incorporating a cultural/value-based cleavage to the original cleavage theory. Finally, we will discuss the impact of the Great Recession on increasing electoral volatility and we will carry an empirical exercise with real-world data to inform a wrapping-up discussion. 

The second block discusses the most relevant demand and supply factors provided by the literature to explain party-system change. We will focus on changes in the socio-economic structure of modern European societies, such as the emergence of new educational divides, the formation of new social classes and the effect of globalization and immigration on altering the preferences of the electorate. On the supply side, we will briefly discuss the role of ideological convergence (between mainstream parties) and issue entrepreneurship (by challenger parties) on carrying political change.

## Requirements and evaluation I (4 credits)

### Attendance and class participation

For obtaining the credits (pass), students are expected to attend at least 80% of the classes.

During class, we will carry interactive exercises, such as in-group debates or interpreting real-world data to derive hypotheses to the phenomena under study. Active engagement in those activities as well as interventions linking the content of the readings to them are expected.

### Readings and response papers

A set of readings for each session will be delivered through OLAT. Students are expected to complete all the mandatory readings (one per session), select one for each weekend (two in total) and write a short response paper (300-500 words) to them. The response papers should be submitted at least 5 days before the corresponding session to alvaro.canalejo@eui.eu.

### Class presentation

Students will be divided into pairs in the last part of the first block. They will be randomly assigned a Western European country (other than Switzerland) and will have to prepare a presentation (30-35 min.) in which they will describe the evolution of its party system until now. Students should make emphasis on periods of change (as opposed to continuity) and use relevant academic literature to justify their arguments. They are not expected to present simple historical reviews, but will be asked to incorporate some of the theories described in class to hypothesize the reasons why each party system has followed a specific pattern, and frame the case comparatively within the European context. Showing empirical evidence will not be mandatory but supporting their arguments with basic statistical analysis will be positively evaluated.

The presentations should be supported by visual material (power point slides or a similar format) and pose two or three questions at the end for class discussion.

## Requirements and evaluation II (4 credits for BA students / 6 credits for MA students)

### Seminar paper

Students choosing to write a seminar paper (around 15 pages for BA students and 25 pages for MA students) will investigate one of the course topic in greater depth. Please, if you are interested in doing a seminar paper for this class get in contact at alvaro.canalejo@eui.eu in advance to discuss the details.
