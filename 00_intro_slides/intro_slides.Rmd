## Introduction to the course

  + **Changes in party systems across Western Europe (WE) have fostered pressuring challenges to democracy**, specially in the last two decades:

    + Traditional parties have lost fuel (sometimes shockingly, e.g., Italy 2013, France 2017) and the results of elections are becoming harder to predict
    
    + Radical parties from the left, but specially from the right, have become mainstream actors in many national parliaments, polarizing the public debate
  
    + The large number and variety of parties in parliament complicates the formation of government (e.g., Germany 2017, Belgium 2019-20) and anticipated elections due to broken coalitions are a permanent risk (e.g., Spain 2019)

  + **What have provoked these changes? Do they affect all Europe equally?** If not, **what does explain this variation?**

  + **This seminar intends to** provide students with conceptual and empirical tools to **answer these questions** with methodological rigour and from a critical perspective

## Course organization

  + The course is designed to review the main political theories of party system formation and change in Europe with empirical applications following a (quasi-)chronological logic

  + It is organized as a **four-days intensive seminar** divided in two weekend blocks:

    1. **The first block consists of a review of European party systems, focusing on their main changes from the 1960s until now**. We will depart from the origins of major political conflicts across WE to later analyse the impact of consecutive 'transformation waves' on their current shape
  
    2. **The second block discusses the most relevant demand and supply factors provided by the literature to explain party-system change**, from the formation of new social classes or the effect of immigration to the role of issue politicization by new challenger parties on altering the preferences of the electorate
    
    3. Additionally, **up to 4 sessions of the second block** will de dedicated to the **students' presentations**

## Requirements and evaluation

To obtain the credits (pass), students are expected to:

  + Attend at least 80% of the classes
  
  + Actively engage during class activities
  
  + Complete all the mandatory readings (one per session)
  
  + Select one reading for each weekend (two in total) and write a short response paper (300-500 words) to them
  
  + Prepare a class presentation (30-35 min.) for the second weekend (in group or individually depending on the number of registered students)

The goal here is to generate **dynamic** interactions during the **seminar**, not to give an unidirectional lecture, so I encourage active engagement in class
