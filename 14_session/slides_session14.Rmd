## Final session

Congratulations!

We have arrived to the last session of the course!

  - Three last things:

    1. Video and debate
    
    2. Final doubts and questions
    
    3. Feedback
    
## Video and debate

We will watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgyjdzfcbps?t=58) by our already beloved Peter Mair on party governance and party system change

The video is a recorded presentation that he held at the Central European University in 2011, just when the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008 hit harder the European Union

## Video and debate

During the viewing, I want you to pay attention and take **notes** of:

  1. Any argument that is related to the concepts studied during the course
  
  2. Any argument that particularly calls your attention, even if it is not directly related to the course
  
Afterwards, we will debate over the **following questions**, so keep them in mind too!

  - How much do the arguments in the video apply to our world today, more than ten years later?
  
  - Do you think that Western democracies (and EU democracies in particular) are worse or better off today?
  
  - What role have recent changes in party systems played on this?
  
## Final doubts and questions

Now it is the moment in which you can have your last word about the content course!

  - Things more problematic

  - Things more interesting
  
  - Other?
  
## Feedback

Finally, I would like to know what things you would change in future versions of this course (and what things you would keep), so please, take a blank sheet, write them down, and give the sheets to me, thanks!

## Goodbye :(

But **it was really a pleasure :)**
